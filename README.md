# Face Recognition
Python scripts that learns faces and later tries to recognize them in images/sites

- It uses `pickle` library to store the face encodings (arrays that mathematically represent each person) in a `.pkl` file.
- And it uses `open-cv2` to image manipulation and `face_recognition` to load the models to recognize faces.
